Used for fun in the 2022 NBA season to see which of the 4 basic prediction models would have the best win rate.
This was built for fun and not with any user in mind so the UI resembles a dumpster fire.

The API I used seems to be down currently. To get this running, I'd have to find a working API, or scrape all of the data from ESPN.  Note, some data is scraped, but I made this project with learning in mind so I tried to diversify.
